# sql-covid-data

## What is it ?

I took data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and I'm working to see what happened the last two years with Covid

## How ?

I'm working on GCP's BigQuery. I split the file in 2, created 2 tables.

## Why ? 

Improve myself in SQL and I'm just curious about what I can found in there :)
